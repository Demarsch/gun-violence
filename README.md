## Project Description/Outline

Every time a mass shooting occurs there are hot debates on whether we need stricter gun laws and more regulations or not. We will try to approach this problem by analyzing the huge amount of gun violence incidents, uncovering some trends and areas that may require special attention and targeted reaction

## Research Questions to Answer

- Which guns contribute most to the number of fatalities?

- Is there any correlation between the use of guns and the demography of the users?

- How do state laws influence the gun voilence?

- Is there any correlation between CCW (carrying a concealed weapon) permit and violence by state?


## Data Sets to be Used

- Comprehensive record of over 260k US gun violence incidents from 2013-2018 https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data

- http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/

- A compilation of gun-related rules and laws per state (https://www.gunstocarry.com/gun-laws-state/)

- A lookup of all guns and their types (source TBD)

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks

- Identify a proper data source for each research question

- Write a code that loads the data from the specific data source on the fly in order to not keep large files in the repository (or takes the data from local source if it has been already downloaded)

- Build a map-related visualization of some stat for drawing the attention (presentation-related)

- Separate tasks on each question that includes data cleaning, pivoting and visualization

- Combine all separate researches into a single notebook

- Make the conclusions and build a presentation
