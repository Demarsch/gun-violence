# Conclusions

- You can't really say whether the laws help or not.  they don't seem to be the deciding factor.  Which probably means its societal problem

- Sadly, the number of incidents, kill and injures constantly grows over time

- It is confirmed that most incidents are of a criminal nature and its a two way road: more guns -> more crimes but also but guns -> more chances to defend yourself

- Even if most gun users are adults, there is a considerable faction that cosists of teenagers and children which is really bad
